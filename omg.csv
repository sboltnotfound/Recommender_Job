But collecting, understanding and taking action on customer data is riddled with market, resource, and technology challenges. Solving these challenges is why we get up in the morning.

OpeninApp    Almost all your favourite creators on Instagram share links to their latest YouTube videos or YouTube channels in their bio or stories. But whenever you tap on those links, you get redirected to the YouTube website instead of the YouTube app. And here you can’t watch the video in full screen nor can you like it, comment on it or subscribe to the channel.

Which is not cool at all….And this is not just so for IG but for all your favourite social media apps eg. YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter, Snapchat, Telegram, Quora etc. So we fixed this problem of sub-optimal user experiences by building a tool that ensures all social media links open in the apps they should.
